The script is made to detect slur words via keylogger and warn user rather in an entertaining way. 

The said keylogger doesn't save or send the logs to anywehere except for the user's host device in the "slur_logs.txt" 

You may want to change this part in the code: (line 100)

trigger_actions = {            

    ## FILL FHIS PLACE WITH WHATEVER YOU WANT.
    # for example: 
    # "slur1": punish0

}
